# Kitty Confs

My personal configuration for the terminal emulator [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). 
Reload changes with `ctrl+shift+f5`. :smile:

## What's it about?

Simple as that, these are my local Kitty config files. 
Keep in mind these are the configurations I feel comfortable with and they may not suits your personal need. Further, I work with a Mac. 

### Me

Used all kids of terminals in the past like vt100, xterm, puTTY, iTerm and now Kitty. 
So far it seems usable and fast enough for my needs.

- `kitty.conf`: Main configuration file for Kitty.
- `kitty-themes`: Contains color themes for Kitty.
- `kitty.app.png` : Mac OS X app icon for Kitty -- this is changeable.
