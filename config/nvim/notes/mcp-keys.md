# MCPHub Keys


[MCPHub](https://github.com/ravitemer/mcphub.nvim) is a Neovim plugin that provides
a way to manage and use API keys for various services.
and as of writing this document (6/2/2025), this is different from [MCPHub Network](https://www.mcphub.net/)
which has its own Desktop application and its own ways to manage. 

For this document we're keeping the focus on the Neovim plugin only.
